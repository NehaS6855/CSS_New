                        <p><b> Sania Mirza</b> (ˈsaːnijaː ˈmirzaː; born 15 November 1986) is an Indian former
                            professional tennis player. A former doubles world No. 1, she won six major titles – three
                            in women's doubles and three in mixed doubles.[4][5] From 2003 until her retirement from
                            singles in 2013, she was ranked by the Women's Tennis Association as the Indian No. 1 in
                            singles.[6][7] Throughout her career, Mirza has established herself as one of the most
                            known, highest-paid, and influential athletes in India.[8][9][10]</p>
                        <p>In singles, Mirza had wins over Svetlana Kuznetsova, Vera Zvonareva, and Marion Bartoli, as
                            well as former world-number-ones Martina Hingis, Dinara Safina, and Victoria Azarenka. She
                            is the highest-ranked Indian female player ever, peaking at world No. 27 in mid-2007.
                            However, a major wrist injury caused her to shift to doubles. Mirza has achieved a number of
                            firsts for women's tennis in India, including reaching the one million-US$ mark in career
                            earnings (currently over US$7.2 million), winning a singles WTA Tour title, and winning a
                            major title, as well as qualifying for (and eventually winning) the WTA Finals in 2014 in
                            doubles partnering Cara Black, and defending her title the following year partnering Martina
                            Hingis.[11] Mirza retired from professional tennis in February 2023.[12]</p>

                        <p>Mirza began playing tennis at the age of six, turning professional in 2003. She was trained
                            by her father. Mirza won ten singles and thirteen doubles titles as a junior player. She won
                            the 2003 Wimbledon Championships girls' doubles title, partnering Alisa Kleybanova. She also
                            reached the semifinals of the 2003 US Open girls' doubles, with Sanaa Bhambri, and the
                            quarterfinals of the 2002 US Open girls' doubles. On the senior circuit, Mirza started to
                            show early success as she made her debut in April 2001 on the ITF Circuit as a 15-year-old.
                            Her highlights of 2001 include a quarterfinal showing in Pune and a semifinal finish in New
                            Delhi. As the 2002 season began, she turned around a season of early losses to winning three
                            straight titles; her first in her hometown Hyderabad and the other two in Manila,
                            Philippines. Mirza clinched the women's gold medal in tennis in 2002 National Games of India

                            on the Fed Cup, winning three straight matches. She helped India win a bronze medal in the
                            mixed doubles event of the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, partnering Leander Paes. In addition,
